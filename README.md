### KoalaKanBan

[Koala Kanban](https://shramp.github.io/KoalaKanBan/)

### Background 

As everyone knows, Koalas lead *very* busy lives. Being a bleeding heart koala sympathizer, I decided to make a kanban board tailored to suit the specific needs of koalas.

### Functionality & MVP  

- [ ] tasks can be sorted within a status or moved between status'
- [ ] Koala's can add new tasks
- [ ] A seeded kanban with some starter tasks for the eager koala.

In addition, this project will include:
- [ ] A production Readme

### Wireframes
 
 Koala kanban will be a single page app with one boards to move tasks around between different status'.

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- react for pretty much everything
- react dnd for dragging and dropping stuff
- redux for app state
- Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.

In addition to the webpack entry file, there will be a few scripts. Probabaly:

- container to hold all the things
- status columns
- task (card)
- -some visual stuff (instructions, welcome, koalas etx)



### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: get project up and running, get react to render some a hello world. get at least a tiny bit of DnD functionality going

**Day 2**: get a really good handle on DnD, decide on applciation state structure

**Day 3**: impliment the various classes, get the kanban board more or less working

**Day 4**: finish functiuonality and do styling. add koala flare
